							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>
								Finite element models are deterministic, and this is a good thing. When you submit 
								the same input file 500 times, you'll get the same answer 500 times. Unfortunately, the 
								computation will 
								take the same amount of time 500 times. This is impractical when we want to 
								run a large number of simulations to explore the parameter space of a process. 
								Checkpointing seeks to solve this issue.

							</p>
							<p>
								Checkpointing is a method of saving the state of a simulation at a given point in time. 
								This allows the user to stop the simulation, and restart it at a later time. 
								This is useful for a number of reasons. 
								For example, if the simulation is running on a cluster, and the user's job is scheduled 
								to end, the user can stop the simulation, and restart it at a later time. 
								COBRA modifies this method by 
								allowing the user to change the mesh between simulations and project the 
								state of the previous simulation onto the new mesh, automatically 
								initializing stateful material properties. 
							</p>
							<p>
								<span class="image right"><img src="images/bigmodel.jpg" alt="" /></span> In discrete 
								processes, such as shot peening and cold spray coating, the net effect of the process 
								can be quantified as the interaction of 
								of many individual events. In shot peening, the compressive stress state of the part 
								is determined by thousands of impacts between 
								shot particles and the part. For a full-scale simualtion of a shot peening process, 
								thousands of particles must be created, each with an associated 
								conact pair that is checked for at each time step, and each with an impact event that 
								induces plastic deformation in the part. 
								The size of the model needed to capture the entire process is often too large to be 
								tractable, in fact, most of the computational effort is spent translating particles through 
								space that are not even in contact with the part! Checkpointing allows us to trim the 
								fat from the model, by simulating one event (in this case, 
								one particle at a time) and shrinking the model size to the region affected by the impact.
							</p>
							<p>
								Shot peening is a great practical example of a Markov process. Essentially a series of random events, 
								where the state of the system after impact n+1 is dependent on the state of the system after impact n, 
								and the probability distributions that describe the speed, size, and shape of particle n+1. In addition, 
								Markov processes have a decay in the memory of the system. If a region is impacted by 40 particles, did the location of the first 
								impact really matter? Probably not. COBRA is well suited to the study of these kinds of processes. 
							</p>
							<p>
								So to summarize, COBRA is a MOOSE based finite element solver that enables block-restriced stateful 
								material property initialization, allowing the mesh to be changed and the solution from a previous simulation 
								projected as the initial state for another step. COBRA is well suited to the study of discrete processes, 
								especially Markov processes where tracking the current state of the system is necessary to 
								predict the future state. COBRA handles simualtion outputs is a systematic way, allowing COBRA-ML to parse the data and 
								build machine learning surrogate models that can provide approximate solutions in a fraction of the time.
